*This repository contains the code and data used for Analysis of various Agricultural Crops.*

## About the Project
Today in agriculture, this can allow crops to be grown at much higher precision, enabling Indian farmer's to treat plants , which in turn significantly increases the effectiveness of farmers' decisions. This project aims to Analyze and evaluate crop quality for individual plant species the based on a set of soil and demographic features of India.


## Requirements
To run the code in this repository, you will need the following Python packages:

pandas<br>
numpy<br>
matplotlib<br>
seaborn<br>
You can install these packages using pip:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn
## Usage
To reproduce the results of this project, run the Crop_Analysis.ipynb Jupyter notebook. This notebook contains all the code used for Visualizing the data, Performing Exploratory Data Analysis.
The Analyzed model is saved as a pickle file (Crop_Analysis.pkl). You can use this file to make further analysis on new data.
## Results
When humidity is less than 65, almost same phosphor levels(approx 14 to 25) are required for 6 crops which could be grown just based on the amount of rain expected over the next few weeks.
